# User Experience UX
### Site Owner's Goal
* Site Owner:
    - As a site owner, I want users to easily understand what the program does.
    - As a site owner, I want users to be able to navigate through the program without any issues.
    - As a site owner, I want users to be able to add their expenses, view their expenses and set their budget goals.

### User Stories

 * Site-users:
    - As a user, I want to understand what the program does instantly. 
    - As a user, I want to be able to add my expenses and confirm if they are correct.
    - As a user, I want to be able to track my expenses.
    - As a user, I want to be able to view my expenses in different formats that are easy to understand.
    - As a user, I want to get visual feedback when I've done something wrong.
    - As a user, I want

### Site Structure

Pennywise is a terminal based application that consists of one page.When the program is run, the user is shown the welcome page with the program's name and a short message explaining what it is. After a short while the user is shown the Main Menu. The Main Menu has four option: add new expense, view statement, view budget goals and exit.

Pennywise was structured with the user in mind, whichever option the user chooses, once they have completed that action they are given the option to go back to the Main Menu or in some cases a sub-menu.

At the top left of the page, just above the console screen, there is a Run Program button which will reload Pennywise.

### Flowchart

The flowchart for Pennywise was made with the online service [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). The goal was to keep it as simple to understand as possible. It was made prior to starting and was a very helpful guide when coding the logic.

### Data Model

[Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/) have been used to store all data. All data the the user inputs and views is retreived from and update to the Google Sheet. The name of the workbook is Pennywise and the name of the worksheet is user1.

The worksheet has 4 columns of data that save the date, category, description and amount of each transaction.

### Design Choices

 - ### Typography
   Due to Pennywise being a terminal based application, no specific typography has been used. The standard font is being used in the terminal.

 - ### Colour Scheme
   Pennywise is back-end program therefore not much styling or visual design has been implementes. 

   * [Ansi Colors](https://pypi.org/project/ansicolors/) library for Python was used to add colour to the program to give visual feedback to the user.
